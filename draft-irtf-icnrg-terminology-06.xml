    <abstract>
		<t>Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a novel paradigm where network communications are accomplished by requesting named content, instead of sending packets to destination addresses. Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) are two prominent ICN architectures. This document provides an overview of the terminology and definitions that have been used in describing concepts in these two implementations of ICN. While there are other ICN architectures, they are not part of the NDN and CCNx concepts and as such are out of scope for this document. This document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).

<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
	<t>Information-centric networking (ICN) is an architecture to evolve the Internet infrastructure from the existing host-centric design to a data-centric architecture, where accessing data by name becomes the essential network primitive. The goal is to let applications refer to data independently of their location or means of transportation, which enables native multicast delivery, ubiquitous in-network caching and replication of data objects. </t>
	
	<t>As the work on this topic continues to evolve, many new terms are emerging. The goal of this document is to collect the key terms with a corresponding definition as they are used in the CCNx and NDN projects. Other ICN projects such as NetInf, or MobilityFirst are not covered and may be the subject of other documents.</t>
	
	<t>To help provide context for the individual defined terms, in this draft we first sketch the bigger picture of an ICN network by introducing the basic concepts and identifying the major components of the architecture in <xref target="a-sketch-of-the-big-picture-of-icn"/>, after which, in <xref target="terms-by-category"/>, ICN related terms are listed by different categories.</t>
	
	<t>While this terminology document describes both confidentiality and integrity-related terms, it should be noted that ICN architectures like NDN and CCNx generally do not provide data confidentiality, which is treated in these architectures as an application layer concern.</t>
	
	<t>This document represents the consensus of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG). It has been reviewed extensively by the Research Group (RG) members active in the specific areas of work covered by the document. It is not an IETF product and is not intended for standardization in the IETF.</t>

  <t>The following list describes the basic ICN concepts needed to discuss the implementation of this service abstraction.</t>
  
  <t><spanx style="strong">Request-Reply Protocol (Interest and Data Packet)</spanx>:</t>
  <t><list style="empty">
		<t>An ICN’s lookup service is implemented by defining two types of network packet formats: Interest packets that request content by name, and Data packets that carry the requested content. The returned Data packet must match the request’s parameters (e.g., having a partially or fully matching name). If the request is ambiguous and several Data packets would satisfy the request, the ICN network returns only one matching Data packet (flow balance between Interest and Data packets over individual links).</t>
	</list></t>
  
	<t><spanx style="strong">Packet and Content Names</spanx></t>
	<t><list style="empty">
		<t>Without a strong cryptographic binding between the name of a Data packet and its content, Data packet names would be useless for fetching specific content. In ICN, verification of a Data packet’s name-to-content binding is achieved through cryptographic means, either by (1) a cryptographic signature that explicitly binds an application-chosen name to a Data packet’s content, or (2) relying on an implicit name (cryptographic hash of the Data packet with or without application-chosen name) that the data consumer obtained through other means.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t><spanx style="strong">Data Authenticity and Encryption</spanx>:</t>
	<t><list style="empty">
		<t>Any data consumer and network element can (in principle) validate the authenticity of a Data packet by verifying its cryptographic name-to-content binding. Note that data authenticity is distinct from data trustworthiness, though the two concepts are related.  A packet is authentic if it has a valid name-to-content binding, but it may still be unwise to "trust" the content for any particular purpose.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t><spanx style="strong">Trust</spanx>:</t>
	<t><list style="empty">
		<t>Data authenticity is distinct from data trustworthiness, though the two concepts are related. A packet is authentic if it has a valid name-to-content binding. A packet is trustworthy, i.e., it comes from a reputable or trusted origin, if this binding is valid in the context of a trust model.</t>
	</list></t>
	
	<t><spanx style="strong">Segmenting and Versioning</spanx>:</t>
	<t><list style="empty">
		<t>An ICN network will be engineered for some packet size limit. As application-level data objects will often be considerably larger, objects must be segmented into multiple Data packets. The names for these Data packets can, for example, be constructed by choosing one application-level object name to which a different suffix is added for each segment. The same method can be used to handle different versions of an application-level object by including a version number into the name of the overall object.</t>
	</list></t>
	
	<t><spanx style="strong">Packet and Frame</spanx>:</t>
	<t><list style="empty">
		<t>NDN and CCNx introduce Protocol Data Units (PDUs) which typically are larger than the maximum transmission unit of the underlying networking technology. We refer to PDUs as packets and the (potentially fragmented) packet parts that traverse MTU-bound links as frames. Handling link-layer technologies which lead to fragmentation of ICN packets is done inside the ICN network and is not visible at the service interface.</t>
	</list></t>
	
	<t><spanx style="strong">ICN Node</spanx>:</t>
	<t><list style="empty">
		<t>A node within an ICN network can fulfill the role of a data producer, a data consumer, and/or a forwarder for Interest and Data packets. When a forwarder has connectivity to neighbor nodes, it performs Interest and Data packet forwarding in real time. It can also behave as a store and forward node, carrying an Interest or Data packet for some time before forwarding it to next node. An ICN node may also run routing protocols to assist its Interest forwarding decisions.</t>
	</list></t>
	
	<t><spanx style="strong">Forwarding Plane</spanx>:</t>
	<t><list style="empty">
		<t>The canonical way of implementing packet forwarding in an ICN network relies on three data structures that capture a node’s state: a Forwarding Interest Table (FIB), a Pending Interest Table (PIT), and a Content Store (CS). It also utilizes Interest forwarding strategies which takes input from both FIB and measurements to make Interest forwarding decisions. When a node receives an Interest packet, it checks its CS and PIT to find a matching entry; if no match is found, the node records the Interest in its PIT and forwards the Interest to the next hop(s) towards the requested content, based on the information in its FIB.</t>

		</list></t>
		
		<t><spanx style="strong">Data packet immutability</spanx>:</t>
		<t><list style="empty">
			<t>After a data packet is created, the cryptographic hash binding the name to the content ensures that neither the content nor the name can change without that hange being detected and the packet discarded. If the content carried in a data packet is intended to be mutable, versioning of the name should be used, so that each version uniquely identifies an immutable instance of the content. This allows disambiguation of coordination in distributed systems.</t>

<section title="Semantics and Usage" anchor="semantics-and-usage">
  
	<t>The terminology described above is the manifestation of intended semantics of NDN and CCNx operations (what do we expect the network to do?). In this section we summarize the most commonly proposed use cases and interpretations.</t>
	
	<section title="Data Transfer" anchor="data-transfer">
    	<t>The networking view of NDN and CCNx is that the request/reply protocol implements a basic, unreliable data transfer service for single, named packets.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Data Transport" anchor="data-transport">
    	<t>Data transfer can be turned into a data transport service for application-level objects by additional logic. This transport logic must understand and construct the series of names needed to reassemble the segmented object. Various flavors of transport can be envisaged (reliable, streaming, mailbox, etc).</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Lookup Service" anchor="lookup-service">
        <t>In a more distributed systems view of the basic request/reply protocol, NDN and CCNx provide a distributed lookup service: given a key value (=name), the service will return the corresponding value.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Database Access" anchor="database-access">
    	<t>A lookup service can be turned into into a database access protocol by using the namespace structure to specify names as access keys into a database. A name prefix therefore stands for a collection or table of a database, while the rest of the name specifies the query expression to be executed.</t>
