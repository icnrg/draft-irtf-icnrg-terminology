# Introduction

Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure from the existing host-centric design to a data-centric architecture where accessing data by name becomes the essential network primitive. The goal is to let applications refer to data independently of their location or means of transportation, which---for immutable data items---enables native multicast delivery, ubiquitous in-network caching and replication of data objects.

As the work on this topic continues to evolve, many new terms are emerging over time. The goal of this document is to provide a thorough collection of these terms with a corresponding definition as they are used in the CCNx and NDN projects. Other, historic ICN projects like NetInf, XIA or Mobility First are not covered and will be the subject of other documents.

To help provide context for the individual terms to be defined, in this draft we first sketch the bigger picture of an ICN network by introducing the basic concepts and identifying the major components of the architecture in section 2 after which in section 3 ICN related terms are listed by different categories.
