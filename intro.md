# Introduction

Information-centric networking (ICN) is an architecture to evolve the Internet infrastructure from the existing host-centric design to a data-centric architecture, where accessing data by name becomes the essential network primitive. The goal is to let applications refer to data independently of their location or means of transportation, which enables native multicast delivery, ubiquitous in-network caching and replication of data objects.

As the work on this topic continues to evolve, many new terms are emerging. The goal of this document is to collect the key terms with a corresponding definition as they are used in the CCNx and NDN projects.  Other ICN projects such as NetInf<!-- [](#netinf) , XIA [](#xia) -->, or MobilityFirst <!-- [](#mobility-first) --> are not covered and will be the subject of other documents.

To help provide context for the individual defined terms, in this draft we first sketch the bigger picture of an ICN network by introducing the basic concepts and identifying the major components of the architecture in [](#a-sketch-of-the-big-picture-of-icn), after which, in [](#terms-by-category), ICN related terms are listed by different categories.

This document represents the consensus of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).  It has been reviewed extensively by the Research Group (RG) members active in the specific areas of work covered by the document. It is not an IETF product and is not intended for standardization in the IETF.
