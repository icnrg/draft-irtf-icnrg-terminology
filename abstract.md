Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm where network communications are
accomplished by requesting named content, instead of sending packets to destination
addresses. Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCN) are two prominent
ICN architectures.  This document provides an overview of the terminology and definitions that
have been used in describing concepts in these two projects.  While there are other ICN
architectures, they are not part of the NDN and CCN vision and as such are out of scope for
this document.
